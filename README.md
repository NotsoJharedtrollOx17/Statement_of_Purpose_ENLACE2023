# Statement_of_Purpose_ENLACE2023
LaTeX code for my Statement of Purpose that I submitted for the ENLACE 2023 Summer Research Camp that took place from June 26 to August 11 in the University of California San Diego

Hi everyone, you can take my SoP files as the format of your own letter. One thing to consider is that the whole structure of the latex code benefits the user
to focus on the writing and less on the technicalities of formatting the document.

The main structure is as follows (inside the /latex dir):
- body.tex: is where the actual writing takes place. The first lines of actual LaTeX code are for the formatting of the headers.
- configuration.tex: is where the format of the document happens. It formats the headers, the spacing, the font type and the numbering of pages.
- Essay_FloresAzcona.tex : is the main file that wraps both body.tex and configuration.tex for the compilation of the document.
- MakeFile: assitant file to compile the document.
